                <p>I am a British expatriate living in the Cuneo region of Piemonte. I arrived in Italy with my wife, 2 kids and dog back in July 2021 and have been working as an outdoor educator, English and science teacher ever since. I have been working in education and nature based outdoor activities for over 10 years. I have worked in the UK, Italy and Malaysia, covering outdoor and community education in woodland, coral reef and coastal environments.</p><p>I have a degree in Environmental Conservation and a PhD in Marine Science and Conservation Psychology and spent several years carrying out educational activities and behavioural research in Malaysia. Alongside my formal education, I have completed multiple 'outdoor educator' courses where I have honed my skills at conducting educational activities and lessons outdoors.<p>I am passionate about the outdoors and the natural world and I love to share this passion with others. I am also a firm believer in the power of nature to heal and transform us and it is for these reasons I love to carry out my educational work in natural spaces.</p>

                                <p>Like Science, my educational methods continue to evolve and adapt regularly. Afterall, no two children are alike and no two children learn in the same way, it is vital that we (educators) allow ourselves freedom to be flexible and change and grow. Just as a sunflower will turn to face the sun, so too do I adapt my teaching methods to suit the needs of the children I teach.</p><p>While my methods will shift and adapt to the needs of the children, there are key elements that together, build my philosophy. <b><i>Curiosity</i></b> forms the foundation, <b><i>Experimentation, Projects, Peers and Play</i></b> form the pillars and, <b><i>being outdoors</i></b> is the roof. I believe that these 5 elements create an engaging, interactive and fun learning environment that builds confidence, passion, critical thinking and resilience.</p>

                                <p>If you have children of your own, or are a teacher, you will know that from a young age, children are constantly asking questions. This is a habit/skill that is educated out of them through conventional schooling. Scenarios where children are required to sit still, quietly and only speak when asked results in obedience but stamps out their natural <i>curiosity</i> about the world around them.</p><p>My methods focus enabling curiosity in children. The learning environment I create is one where children are encouraged not only to ask questions but given the opportunity to discuss and explore the answers together.This question, or inquiry, based learning creastes a scenario where children not only learn the academic topics, but they develop <b><i>socially</i></b> through debate and discussion, <b><i>critical thinking</i></b> through reasoning, experimentation and exploration of topics and <b><i>resilience</i></b> through problem solving and perseverance, also learning how to move forward when faced with incorrect or misaligned beliefs. </p>

                                        <p>There are not many jobs, if any, that exist where you don't have to interact with, or work with other people. It is a fact of life that unless you become a hermit, you are going to have to manage relationships with other people. Whether it is within an office, school or customer based environment, we can't avoid it. This leads us to <b>colleagues</b> , where attention is given to working in groups in class to develop social skills, reasoning, critical thinking and the ability to listen and contribute to something beyond your own personal gains. <p>This ties closely to <b>projects</b> where students are given opportunities to develop their own ideas and experiments in the form of projects. Working on a project individually or in groups offers the chance to work with more freedom, to be imaginative and creative and to explore the world beyond a strict curriculum based theme. This approach is child-focused, allowing them to tackle real world problems or investigate areas they are passionate about resulting in much more meaningful and a deeper understanding of their topic.</p>

                                </header>
                                <p>When it comes to supporting learning in children, it is important to remember that children learn best when doing something they enjoy. This is why <b>experimentation</b> and <b>play</b> are so important in my educational philosophy. Students who have the opportunity to experience or observe something in the real world, will have a much easier task to understand the topic on a deeper level. I regularly use a range of practical tasks and games to help student understanding of concepts, processes or topics.</p><p>The process of conducting an experiment, whether it works or fails, is something that builds key skills in students, from creativity, critical thinking and problem solving to developing the ability and emotional understanding of failure. Students who ask a question, develop a hypothesis and methodology then conduct an experiement and discuss the results will ultimately understand the topic more effectively than those who have studied only in a classroom using textbooks.</p><p>Play is likewise an important part of learning. Children learn so much through play and we often think that as they start to grow up, the benefit of games and play is lessened, with more time spent at their desks. However, including game play into more complex topics is a great way to engage students and get them thinking about the topic in a way they can follow and understand and even visualise. I often use play for teaching science topics such as natural cycles, food chains, animal adaptations, energy and the human body.</p>

                                </header>
                                <p>Outdoor Education has seen quite a rise in popularity in recent years with many schools dedicated to teaching outdoors popping up in America and Europe. I Nam a nature enthusiast and believe that the outdoors is a vital part of a child's education. I believe that children who are given the opportunity to learn outdoors will develop a deeper understanding of the world around them and a greater appreciation for the natural world.</p><p>There is growing evidence that outdoor education provides an alternative, but effective approach to education for our children. Time spent in nature reduces stress, increases concentration and the fresh air and availability of real world experiences create an almost perfect learning environment. I have found students who are disruptive or problematic while sat indoors at a desk flourish while learning outdoors.</p><p>It is important to note however that outdoor education should not be confused with 'forest schooling', where children are given freedom to roam without structure. Outdoor education is first and foremost, a method of education that is structured in a way that maximises student learning through specific goals and outcomes. Utilising strucutred play, experimentation, group work and projects in an outdoor environment results in engaging, interactice and exciting lessons for students and teachers.</p>
