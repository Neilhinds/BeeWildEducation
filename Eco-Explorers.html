    <p>The Eco-Explorers project is open to all children aged 6 and up and the 2 hour weekly session provides opportunities for children to develop practical skills, develop coordination and motor skills, improve socialisation skills and develop their comprehension of the English language.</p>

          <h3>Practical Skills</h3>
        </header>
        <p>As part of the Eco-Explorers club, children get introduced to the use of tools such as saws, knives, hammers and drills as we work to construct and create with wood. We also explore the magic of <em>fire</em> as we cook food, make soap and explore history through casting metal and making charcoal. Introducing children to these skills is vital for their ability to assess risks in day to day life as well as develop hand-eye coordination, physical strength and fitness. It also builds confidence in children as they improve and learn new skills such as fire lighting, whittling or construction.</p>

        </header>
        <p>The wonder of child-led education and activities results in children developing in their own time and way. In this way, children build confidence in their bodies and learn about it's capabilities through exploration, play and experimentation. Developing control of their grand motor skills through climbing and exploring in nature creates a lasting bond between children and nature that will stay with them until adulthood.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Creativity is important for children to develop and engage with as it encourages 'outside of the box' thinking and supports problem solving, skills which are vital for us as adults. Creativity is inclusive in all our play, crafts and learning. Children are given freedom to draw, create and play in their own way. The only thing I ask is that they do their best! </p>

      <h2>English Language Comprehension</h2>
    </header>
    <p>As all projects and activities I run, the English language takes precedence. Throughout each session I speak with the children in English, using simple phrases and repetition to help them to begin understanding the langugage. I do not focus on teaching vocabulary, instead children are immersed in English, and must listen and try to start understanding phrases, rather than a single word. This method improves the ability for children to develop their English in the classroom due to the improved understanding of the formation of questions and phrases (as opposed to knowing lots of individual words).</p>
